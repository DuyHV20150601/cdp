# Salesforce Marketing Cloud Setup Guide

Follow our setup guide to connect Salesforce Marketing Cloud to SkyPoint.

### Step 1: Obtain Client ID and Client Secret

Perform the following steps to retrieve the Client ID and Client Secret for a new package:

1.  Log in to Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

2.  Go to **Setup****Apps****Installed Packages**.

3.  Click **New** to create a new package.

4.  In the New Package Details window, enter the name and description for the package.

    To use OAuth 2.0, select **Create with enhanced functionality (recommended)**.

5.  Click **Add Component**.

6.  Select **API Integration** as the component type.

7.  Click **Next**.

8.  Select **Server-to-Server** as the integration type.

9.  Click **Next**.

10.  Select the following permissions for the Server-to-Server properties:

    -   List and Subscribers - Read, Write

    -   Marketing Cloud Connect - Read, Write

    -   Data Extensions - Read, Write

    These are the minimum permissions required to use Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector.

11.  Click **Save**.

    The Components section displays the Client ID and Client Secret for the package.    

Perform the following steps to retrieve the Client ID and Client Secret for an existing package:

1.  Go to **Setup****Apps****Installed Packages**.

    

    The Installed Packages page lists all the packages installed in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud account.

    

2.  Select a package and go to the **Components** section.

    

    -   To add a new component, click **Add Component**.

    -   To edit existing component, click **Edit**.

    

    The Components section displays the Client ID and Client Secret for the package.

    

3.  Click **Save**.

If an existing package uses OAuth 1.0, you cannot edit the package to use OAuth 2.0. You must create a new package to use OAuth 2.0. SkyPoint recommends that you upgrade to OAuth 2.0 before Salesforce Marketing Cloud drops support for OAuth 1.0.

Select API Integration as the component type.
