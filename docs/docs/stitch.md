## Stitch Overview

How SkyPointâ€™s approach to identity resolution produces rich, accurate, and precise customer 360 profiles. 

There are two phases in the process of building customer 360 profiles. 

Phase I: Data preparation - all of the initial work needed to get data into a Common Data Model (CDM) environment and prepare it for the matching process.

Phase II: Identity resolution, where records and identities are assigned to unique individuals.

The fundamental task that identity resolution is trying to accomplish is to identify the same individual person within and across all data sources that contain customer information. 

There are two approaches that are generally used for this purpose:

1. Unique Identifier approach and the Static Rule approach.
