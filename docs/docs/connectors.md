# Connectors

## Connector Overview

SkyPoint has the ability to ingest data from any data source including pre-built connectors with popular applications (e.g. Shopify, Salesforce etc.), web activity through our JavaScript tag as well as custom data sources (e.g. Amazon S3, Azure Blob etc). 

SkyPoint ingests raw data and transforms it into Common Data Model (an open source standard) for further processing like Stich and Timelines.
