# SkyPoint Customer Data Platform (CDP)

Customer data makes up the foundation of an organization. It tells whoâ€™s buying, what they want, and how best to reach them. But for many businesses, customer data is siloed across systems, impossible to unify, and not actionable across the organization.

We built SkyPoint Customer Data Platform (CDP) from the ground up to solve this problem by unifying all your customer data at scale, delivering a complete customer 360 and predictive insights. 

## How Does It Work?

SkyPoint CDP is a realcdp.org complaint SaaS product. It provides following key capabilities:

- Ingest data from any source
- Capture full detail of ingested data
- Store ingested data indefinitely (subject to privacy constraints)
- Create unified profiles of identified individuals/customers/consumers/leads/prospects etc. (360 degree-view)
  - [Common Data Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/common-data-model/) compliant unified profiles can then be segmented and enriched to create highly flexible targets for marketing or further analysis.
- Share data with any system that needs it (E.g. personalization, seo/sem, marketing, analytics, AI/machine learning etc.)
  - Utilize [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/) to create automated workflows and no-code solutions.
